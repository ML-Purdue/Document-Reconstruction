Pipeline:
    Load image (done)
    Pre-processing (thresholding)
	Iterated through image to get a list of colors
	Got a list of color appearances
    Feature extraction (blob detection, boundary points, text recognition)
    Iterative algorithms (random transforms, minimizing error functions, collisions and sliding)
    Display (done)
